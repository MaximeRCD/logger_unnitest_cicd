## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The `unittest` library is Python's built-in module for writing and running tests. This library allows for automated testing, set up of test preconditions, and test environments, as well as extensions of the test framework.

---

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Being a standard Python library, `unittest` requires no installation. If you have Python installed, you have `unittest`.

---

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

The core of the `unittest` framework is centered around `TestCase` classes. A simple test case might look like this:

```python
import unittest

class MyFirstTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_example(self):
        self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 2)
```

In the above code, we define a test case `MyFirstTest` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. Inside this test case, we define a single test method, `test_example`, that asserts that 1 + 1 equals 2.

---

## Writing Tests <a name="writing-tests"></a>

Each test you write will be a method in a `TestCase` subclass that begins with the word `test`. This is how `unittest` recognizes which methods represent tests.

```python
class MyTests(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_addition(self):
        self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 2)

    def test_subtraction(self):
        self.assertEqual(3 - 2, 1)
```

---

## Test Suites <a name="test-suites"></a>

Test suites are used to aggregate tests from different test cases into a collection that should be run together. Here is an example:

```python
def suite():
    suite = unittest.TestSuite()
    suite.addTest(MyTests('test_addition'))
    suite.addTest(MyTests('test_subtraction'))
    return suite

if __name__ == '__main__':
    runner = unittest.TextTestRunner()
    runner.run(suite())
```

---

## Running Tests <a name="running-tests"></a>

You can run tests by calling `unittest.main()`. This will run the tests and report the results:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

---

## Test Discovery <a name="test-discovery"></a>

`unittest` supports test discovery. This means that you can start a process in a directory and `unittest` will automatically discover tests in `.py` files starting with `test`. Here's how to run it:

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

---

## Skipping Tests <a name="skipping-tests"></a>

You can skip individual tests or entire test cases using the `@unittest.skip` decorator:

```python
@unittest.skip("This is a skipped test.")
def test_example(self):
    pass
```

---

## Test Outcomes <a name="test-outcomes"></a>

There are three types of test outcomes in

 `unittest`:

1. **OK** – The test passes.
2. **FAIL** – The test does not pass, and an AssertionError exception is raised.
3. **ERROR** – The test raises an exception other than an AssertionError.

---

## Assertions <a name="assertions"></a>

`unittest` provides a number of assertion methods you can use to test your code. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

- `assertEqual(a, b)` – Checks that a == b.
- `assertNotEqual(a, b)` – Checks that a != b.
- `assertTrue(x)` – Checks that bool(x) is True.
- `assertFalse(x)` – Checks that bool(x) is False.
- `assertIs(a, b)` – Checks that a is b.
- `assertIsNot(a, b)` – Checks that a is not b.
- `assertIsNone(x)` – Checks that x is None.
- `assertIsNotNone(x)` – Checks that x is not None.

For a full list of assertion methods, refer to the [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#assert-methods).

---

## Mocking <a name="mocking"></a>

The `unittest.mock` module provides a `Mock` class to create mock objects in your tests, and a `patch()` decorator to replace parts of the system that you're testing. This is useful in isolating your tests from the rest of the system and ensuring that your tests are truly unit tests.

Here's an example of how you can use `unittest.mock`:

```python
from unittest.mock import MagicMock
thing = ProductionClass()
thing.method = MagicMock(return_value=3)
thing.method(3, 4, 5, key='value')
```

---

## Advanced Concepts <a name="advanced-concepts"></a>

- **Test Doubles**: These are simplified versions of complex production code that are used for testing. They come in various forms, such as mocks, stubs, and fakes.

- **Test Setup and Teardown**: These are methods that you can add to your `TestCase` subclasses to handle test preparation and cleanup. The `setUp` method is run prior to each test, while the `tearDown` method is run after each test.

- **Class and Module Level Setup and Teardown**: In addition to `setUp` and `tearDown`, `unittest` provides `setUpClass` and `tearDownClass` for class-level setup and teardown operations, as well as `setUpModule` and `tearDownModule` for module-level setup and teardown operations.

---

## Tips and Tricks <a name="tips-and-tricks"></a>

- Keep your tests small and focused. Each test should test one specific aspect of your code.

- Use clear and descriptive test method names. This makes it easier to understand what a test does and why it might be failing.

- Use the `setUp` and `tearDown` methods to avoid duplicating setup code across multiple tests.

- Don't forget about `unittest.mock`! It can be very handy for isolating your tests from external systems or complex parts of your own system.
